# California-house-price-prediction
Regression predictive modeling machine learning problem in R.

Each record in the database describes a California houses. The data was drawn from the California district and some summary stats about them based on the 1990 census. The attributes are deÔ¨Åned as follows:

    Longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west
    Latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north
    Housingmedianage: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building
    total_rooms: Total number of rooms within a block
    total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block
    Population: Total number of people residing within a block
    Households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
    Median_income: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
    Medianhousevalue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
    Ocean_proximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea

In this, I have used:

    Multiple Linear Regression
    KNN Regression
    Regression Tree
    Random Forest Regressor
    Neural Network and compare which one of them gives me the most fitted model to predict the house price.

Data taken from Kaggle.
